# With a unfair dice, the probability of point 2 is twice than point 1, probability of point 3 is triple than point 1, and so on. What is the expected value and variance of this dice?

As we don't know how many sides the dice has, we denote the number of sides on the dice as n. We are given that the probability of rolling a 1 is some base value, say p(1). Then, the probabilities for higher numbers follow a specific pattern:
- p(2) = 2 * p(1)
- p(3) = 3 * p(1)
- ...
- p(n) = n * p(1)

The propability of roling any number is proportional to its value.

### Expected Value

The expected value (average outcome) is calculated by considering the product of each outcome (number rolled) and its corresponding probability, and then summing these products across all possible outcomes. In mathematical notation, this is represented as:

E = ∑(x * p(x)) for all x (from 1 to n)

E is the expected value, x is the number rolled (outcome) and p(x) is the probability of rolling x

### Variance
The variance tells us how spread out the outcomes are from the expected value. It's calculated by finding the squared deviations from the mean (expected value) weighted by their probabilities and summing them up for all outcomes.

Variance = Σ((x - E)^2 * p(x)) for all x (from 1 to n)
Variance is denoted by the symbol σ^2, E is the expected value (previously calculated), x is the number rolled (outcome) and p(x) is the probability of rolling x
