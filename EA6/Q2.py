print("Conclusion:")
print("Running these functions will show a win rate around 66.67% for switching doors and 33.33% for staying on the same door. This reinforces the counterintuitive nature of the Monty Hall problem â€“ switching doors nearly doubles your chance of winning!")

print("My thoughts:")
print("The Monty Hall problem is a fascinating example of how seemingly logical intuition can be wrong when dealing with probability. By revealing a goat behind one of the unchosen doors, Monty provides valuable information that allows you to effectively choose the remaining door with a higher chance of having the car. It's a great example of the power of conditional probability.")
